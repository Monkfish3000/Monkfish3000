- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael from Yorkshire, England. Currently living in Barcelona, Spain. I'm a graduate of the Le Wagon coding bootcamp and
and I'm working as a Software Engineer in a global EdTech. company. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in education, technology, data analytics and football although my team, Barnsley, aren't very good so they make being
interested in them very hard work sometimes. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning many different things but my main focus tends to be FrontEnd technologies - React, Svelte etc. I'm always
trying to hone my Javascript and Typescript skills and the learn the latest library.
